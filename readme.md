# Smart Contract Security 
A collection of resources, best practices, and tools for improving the security of smart contracts.

Tools i'm using to analyze any vulnerabilities :-

# Here are some best practices for writing secure smart contracts:

- Avoid using inline assembly in your code as much as possible, 
   as it can be difficult to understand and audit.
- Use libraries or packages with well-tested code instead of
   writing your own code for common functionality.
- Test your smart contracts thoroughly and extensively, including edge 
   cases and unexpected scenarios.
- Regularly review and update your smart contracts to address any 
  security vulnerabilities that are discovered.


# Checklist
 Here is a checklist for ensuring the security of your smart contracts:

- Verify that all the inputs and outputs of the smart contract are properly validated.
- Verify that the smart contract has sufficient access controls to prevent unauthorized access.
- Verify that the smart contract does not have any infinite loops or reentrancy vulnerabilities.
- Verify that the smart contract does not have any integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities.
- Verify that the smart contract does not have any vulnerabilities related to time manipulation.
